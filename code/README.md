To run the code, it has to have name "code.py". 


There are two versions of the code: "code.py" and "code_v2.py":


"code.py" is based on the comparison of two values ​​- "dry_val" and the actual soil moisture value. When the actual soil moisture value is less than the minimum allowed value (dry_val), the soil will be automatically irrigated until the moisture value is greater than dry_val

"code_v2.py" uses a simple machine learning model that learns how long to water the plant so that its final soil moisture value is the same as a pre-defined desired value - "chcena_val"


In the folder ___ there are codes for testing the functionality of individual sensors

# Ecological-Automation-of-Plant-Care
We are currently facing many environmental challenges, such as global warming and water scarcity, which pose great challenges for effective sustainable plant cultivation. Traditional methods of irrigation and care often lead to insufficient watering or, conversely, to overflowing the plants, which not only wastes water, but can also cause soil rot, which can later appear on the products.

 
 In the future, an innovative solution to these problems may be ecological automation of plant care, which combines automated irrigation based on machine learning and recycling of excess water.

 
 The main goal of the work is to create an automated system that monitors and controls soil irrigation, while responding to environmental factors such as air humidity and ambient temperature. An important part of the project is also efficient water management through its recycling. Excess water is captured, filtered and reused, which significantly contributes to reducing consumption and promotes sustainability.

 
 This work describes in detail the individual steps of the development of this device from the design to the implementation of sensors and machine learning algorithms.
